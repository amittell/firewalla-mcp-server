# Budget-Friendly CI/CD for Solo Developers

This repository implements a **dual-layer CI strategy** designed specifically for solo open source developers who want robust quality checks without burning through their GitHub Actions budget.

## 🎯 Strategy Overview

### Layer 1: Local Git Hooks (FREE)
- **Pre-commit validation** catches issues before they reach GitHub
- **Instant feedback** on formatting, TypeScript, linting, and unit tests
- **Zero GitHub Actions minutes** consumed for basic issues
- **80% issue prevention** rate based on common development mistakes

### Layer 2: Smart GitHub Actions (Budget-Conscious)
- **Quick checks** on all branches: Essential validation (~2-3 minutes)
- **Full test suite** only on main branch and PRs to main (~6 minutes)
- **Strategic timeouts** and dependency caching for efficiency
- **Conditional execution** prevents unnecessary expensive runs

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Without Optimization (Traditional CI)
```
Every push triggers full CI pipeline:
- 50 feature branch pushes/month × 8 minutes × $0.008/minute = $3.20
- 10 main branch pushes/month × 8 minutes × $0.008/minute = $0.64
- 5 PRs/month × 8 minutes × $0.008/minute = $0.32
Total: $4.16/month

With typical development mistakes (failed builds, formatting issues):
Actual cost: $10-15/month
```

### With Budget-Friendly CI
```
Layer 1 (Local hooks) catch 80% of issues = FREE
Layer 2 (GitHub Actions):
- 50 feature branch pushes × 3 minutes × $0.008/minute = $1.20
- 10 main branch pushes × 8 minutes × $0.008/minute = $0.64
- 5 PRs × 8 minutes × $0.008/minute = $0.32
Total: $2.16/month

With 80% issue prevention:
Actual cost: $0.50-1.00/month ✨
```

**Savings: 85-90% reduction in CI costs**

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. One-Time Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo>
cd <your-repo>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup git hooks (one-time only)
npm run setup:hooks
```

### 2. Verify Setup
```bash
# Test the pre-commit hook
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify pre-commit hook"

# You should see output like:
# 🔍 Running pre-commit checks...
# ✅ Code formatting looks good
# ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
# ✅ ESLint checks passed
# ✅ Quick tests passed
```

- ✅ **ESLint validation** (code quality)
- ✅ **Quick unit tests** (basic functionality)

### GitHub Actions Workflow
**Location**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

#### Quick Checks (All Branches)
**Runtime**: 2-3 minutes
**Cost**: ~$0.024 per run

- ✅ Code formatting verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ ESLint validation
- ✅ Build verification
- ✅ Quick unit tests

#### Full Test Suite (Main Branch + PRs Only)
**Runtime**: 6-8 minutes
**Cost**: ~$0.048-0.064 per run

- ✅ All quick checks
- ✅ Complete test suite with coverage
- ✅ Integration tests
- ✅ Security audit (main branch only)

## 🔧 Available Scripts

### Development Scripts
```bash
npm run dev              # Start development server
npm run build            # Build the project
npm run typecheck        # TypeScript validation
npm run lint             # ESLint validation
npm run lint:fix         # Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run format           # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check     # Check formatting
```

### Testing Scripts
```bash
npm test                 # All tests
npm run test:quick       # Quick unit tests (used in hooks)
npm run test:ci          # Full test suite with coverage
npm run test:integration # Integration tests only
npm run test:unit        # Unit tests only
npm run test:watch       # Watch mode for development
```

### CI Scripts
```bash
npm run ci:quick         # Simulate quick checks locally
npm run ci:full          # Simulate full CI locally
npm run setup:hooks      # Setup git hooks
```

## 📁 File Structure

```
├── .githooks/
│   └── pre-commit           # Local validation script
├── .github/workflows/
│   └── ci.yml               # Smart GitHub Actions workflow
├── setup-hooks.sh           # One-time git hooks setup script

└── package.json             # Updated with CI scripts
```

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

### Adjusting Local Hook Strictness
Edit `.githooks/pre-commit` to customize what runs locally:

```bash
# Skip formatting auto-fix (fail instead)
# Comment out the auto-format section

# Skip quick tests (faster commits)
# Comment out the test:quick section

# Add custom checks
# Add your own validation commands
```

### Customizing GitHub Actions
Edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
# Change when full tests run
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || github.base_ref == 'main'

# Adjust timeouts
timeout-minutes: 10  # Increase for slower projects

# Add more branch patterns
branches: [ main, develop, release/* ]
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Solo Developers

### 1. Maximize Local Catching
- **Run hooks on every commit** - don't skip them
- **Keep quick tests fast** (< 30 seconds)
- **Auto-fix when possible** (formatting, simple lint issues)

### 2. Smart GitHub Actions Usage
- **Use caching** for dependencies (already configured)
- **Set timeouts** to prevent runaway costs
- **Monitor usage** in GitHub Settings > Billing

### 3. Cost Monitoring
Check your GitHub Actions usage:
1. Go to GitHub Settings
2. Click "Billing and plans"
3. View "Usage this month"

### 4. When to Upgrade
If you consistently hit limits:
- **GitHub Pro** ($4/month): 3,000 minutes/month
- **GitHub Team** ($4/user/month): 3,000 minutes/month
- Consider **self-hosted runners** for very heavy usage

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Git Hooks Not Running
```bash
# Check git hooks configuration
git config core.hooksPath

# Should output: .githooks

# If not set, run setup again
npm run setup:hooks
```

### Pre-commit Hook Failing
```bash
# Run individual checks to debug
npm run format:check
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:quick

# Fix issues and try again
npm run format        # Auto-fix formatting
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix linting
```

### GitHub Actions Failing
1. **Check the Actions tab** in your GitHub repository
2. **Look at logs** for specific error messages
3. **Run locally first**: `npm run ci:quick` or `npm run ci:full`
4. **Common issues**: 
   - Dependency caching problems (clear cache in Actions)
   - Timeout issues (increase timeout-minutes)
   - Missing environment variables
