# Firewalla MCP Server - Fixes Applied

## Date: 2025-07-12

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to address issues identified in the comprehensive test report.

## P0 Critical Issues - FIXED

### 1. Schema-Implementation Mismatches (✅ FIXED)
- **Fixed:** `get_device_status` schema maximum updated from 10000 to 1000
- **Fixed:** `get_network_rules` schema maximum updated from 10000 to 1000  
- **Note:** `get_flow_data` was already fixed to 1000

### 2. Search Logic Bugs (✅ FIXED)
- **Fixed:** `search_rules` now passes query parameter to `getNetworkRules()` instead of `undefined`
- **Fixed:** `search_alarms` strategy updated to include all necessary parameters (group_by, cursor)
- **NEW FIX:** `search_rules` now includes comprehensive client-side filtering to ensure results match query criteria:
  - Action filtering (e.g., "action:block" returns only rules with block action)
  - Target value filtering with wildcard support (e.g., "target_value:*.facebook.com")
  - Status filtering (e.g., "status:active")
- **NEW FIX:** `search_alarms` now includes comprehensive client-side filtering as fallback for API limitations:
  - Severity filtering (e.g., "severity:medium" returns only medium severity alarms)
  - Type filtering with comparison operators (e.g., "type:>=4")
  - Status and resolved state filtering
  - Source IP filtering with wildcard support

## P1 High Priority Issues - PARTIALLY FIXED

### 3. Backend API Failures (✅ LIKELY FIXED)
- **Fixed:** `get_geographic_statistics` query syntax updated from `timestamp:[start TO end]` to `ts:start-end`
- **Note:** This should resolve the "Bad Request: Invalid parameters sent to /v2/flows" error
- **Action Required:** Live testing needed to confirm fix

## P2 Medium Priority Issues - FIXED

### 4. Decimal Hours Validation (✅ FIXED)
- **Fixed:** `get_recent_rules` now accepts decimal hours (minimum changed from 1 to 0.1)
- **Fixed:** Schema updated to reflect decimal support with appropriate description

### 5. Correlation Suggestions (✅ FIXED)
- **Fixed:** Expanded correlation field list from 7 fields to 29 comprehensive fields
- **Fixed:** Now includes all major field types: network, geographic, application, device, and security fields

## Summary of Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `/src/server.ts` - Schema definitions updated for accurate limits
2. `/src/tools/search.ts` - Multiple fixes for search logic and correlation
3. `/src/tools/handlers/rules.ts` - Decimal hours validation fix

### Key Improvements:
- Documentation now accurately reflects implementation limits
- Search functionality should work correctly with proper query filtering
- Decimal hours support enables more granular time-based queries
- Correlation suggestions should now return meaningful results
- Geographic statistics should no longer fail with API errors

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing Required:**
   - Test geographic statistics with `entity_type="flows"`
   - Test cross-reference searches to verify API compatibility
   - Verify search_rules returns only matching action types
   - Confirm search_alarms returns results for severity queries

2. **Automated Testing:**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run test:validation
   npm run test:error-handling
   ```

## Production Readiness

With these fixes applied, the Firewalla MCP Server should be significantly more reliable and accurate. The critical P0 issues have been resolved, and most P1/P2 issues have been addressed. Live testing is recommended to confirm all fixes work as expected in the production environment.
