PERFECT TOOLS (100% Success):
‚úÖ get_boxes
‚úÖ get_simple_statistics

HIGH PERFORMING TOOLS (92%):
‚úÖ get_active_alarms, get_flow_data, get_device_status, get_bandwidth_usage
‚úÖ get_network_rules, get_flow_trends, search_flows

VERIFICATION INFRASTRUCTURE:
‚úÖ V1: Fixed tool discovery parsing - accurate measurements achieved
‚è≥ V2: Response format detection accuracy needs improvement
‚è≥ V3: Edge case test scenarios needed
‚è≥ V4: 100% success criteria framework needed

NEXT TARGETS FOR 100%:
- Address 47 warning-level issues (mostly response format detection)
- Improve pagination support detection
- Enhance error handling detection
- Add optimization pattern recognition

REMAINING OPTIMIZATION POTENTIAL:
- 14 percentage points to reach 100% (86% ‚Üí 100%)
- Focus areas: Rules category (78% ‚Üí 100%), response format consistency
- Most critical: get_network_rules_summary, get_recent_rules, get_most_active_rules
