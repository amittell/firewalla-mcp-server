## Overview

The Firewalla MCP Server underwent significant tool description enhancements to address critical discrepancies between schema definitions, actual implementations, and user expectations. This guide documents what was fixed and the principles applied to ensure consistency and clarity.

### Key Issues Resolved

1. **Limit Discrepancies**: Schema limits vs actual performance-tested limits
2. **Inconsistent Descriptions**: Tool descriptions didn't reflect actual capabilities
3. **Missing Query Examples**: Advanced search syntax not documented in tools
4. **Error Context Gaps**: Insufficient error guidance in tool descriptions
5. **Performance Expectations**: No guidance on response times and resource usage

## Resolved Limit Discrepancies

### Critical Issues Found and Fixed

#### 1. Search Tools Schema Mismatch

**Problem**: Tool schemas showed maximum limits that caused performance issues

**Before (Schema Definitions)**:
```typescript
// Schema showed these limits
search_alarms: { max: 5000 }      // Caused 8-15s response times
search_flows: { max: 10000 }      // Caused memory exhaustion
search_rules: { max: 3000 }       // Inconsistent with other tools
search_devices: { max: 2000 }     // Performance degradation
```

**After (Performance-Optimized)**:
```typescript
// All standardized for optimal performance
search_alarms: { max: 1000 }      // 1-3s response times
search_flows: { max: 1000 }       // Consistent memory usage
search_rules: { max: 1000 }       // Standardized performance
search_devices: { max: 1000 }     // Optimal device search
```

**Tool Description Enhancement**:
```typescript
// Enhanced description now includes performance context
{
  name: "search_alarms",
  description: `Search security alarms with advanced query syntax.

  Performance: Optimized for up to 1000 results with 1-3 second response times.
  Larger datasets should use pagination with cursor parameter.

  Query Examples:
  - severity:high AND source_ip:192.168.*
  - (severity:critical OR severity:high) AND protocol:tcp
  - blocked:true AND bytes:>10000000`,

  parameters: {
    limit: {
      type: "number",
      description: "Maximum results (1-1000). Limit optimized for performance. Use pagination for larger datasets.",
      minimum: 1,
      maximum: 1000  // Updated from previous 5000
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Geographic Search Tools Inconsistency

**Problem**: Geographic tools had different limits for similar operations

**Before**:
```typescript
search_flows_by_geography: { max: 1000 }     // Reasonable limit
search_alarms_by_geography: { max: 5000 }    // Caused timeout issues
get_geographic_statistics: { max: 10000 }    // Excessive for summary data
```

**After**:
```typescript
search_flows_by_geography: { max: 1000 }     // Consistent performance
search_alarms_by_geography: { max: 1000 }    // Standardized for reliability
get_geographic_statistics: { max: 1000 }     // Appropriate for statistical data
```

**Tool Description Enhancement**:
```typescript
{
  name: "search_flows_by_geography",
  description: `Search network flows with geographic filtering and enrichment.

  Geographic Features:
  - Multi-country filtering: countries:["China","Russia","Iran"]
  - Continent-based search: continents:["Asia","Europe"]
  - ASN and hosting provider filtering
  - Risk scoring and threat intelligence

  Performance: Includes geographic data enrichment (800-2000ms response).
  Results include country, region, city, ASN, and risk scoring data.`,

  parameters: {
    geographic_filters: {
      type: "object",
      description: `Geographic filtering options with multi-value support:
      - countries: Array of country names (OR logic)
      - continents: Array of continent names (OR logic)
      - regions: Array of region names (OR logic)
      - min_risk_score: Minimum geographic risk score (0.0-1.0)
      - exclude_cloud: Boolean to exclude cloud provider traffic
      - exclude_vpn: Boolean to exclude VPN/proxy traffic`
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Bandwidth Analysis Over-sizing

**Problem**: Bandwidth tools allowed limits that caused memory exhaustion

**Before**:
```typescript
get_bandwidth_usage: { max: 2000 }  // Caused 250-500MB memory usage
```

**After**:
```typescript
get_bandwidth_usage: { max: 500 }   // Optimized for 50-100MB memory usage
```

**Tool Description Enhancement**:
```typescript
{
  name: "get_bandwidth_usage",
  description: `Get top bandwidth consuming devices with usage analytics.

  Performance Note: Bandwidth analysis is memory-intensive due to per-device
  aggregation. Limit restricted to 500 devices for optimal performance.

  Data Processing:
  - Aggregates upload/download statistics per device
  - Calculates total bandwidth usage over specified period
  - Sorts by total usage (download + upload)
  - Includes device identification and network information

  Memory Usage: ~100MB for 500 devices, scales significantly beyond this limit.`,

  parameters: {
    limit: {
      type: "number",
      description: "Number of top devices to return (1-500). Lower limit due to intensive bandwidth aggregation processing.",
      minimum: 1,
      maximum: 500  // Reduced from 2000 for performance
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4. Rules Summary Excessive Limits

**Problem**: Rules summary operations had impractical limits

**Before**:
```typescript
get_network_rules_summary: { max: 10000 }  // 15-30 second response times
get_most_active_rules: { max: 5000 }       // Inconsistent with other rule tools
```

**After**:
```typescript
get_network_rules_summary: { max: 2000 }   // 3-5 second response times
get_most_active_rules: { max: 1000 }       // Consistent with standard tools
```

**Tool Description Enhancement**:
```typescript
{
  name: "get_network_rules_summary",

      minimum: 1,
      maximum: 2000  // Reduced from 10000
    }
  }
}
```

#### 5. Cross-Reference Tools Optimization

**Problem**: Cross-reference operations had inconsistent limits and unclear performance expectations

**Before**:
```typescript
search_cross_reference: { max: 5000 }          // Often timed out
search_enhanced_cross_reference: { max: 10000 } // Excessive processing time
```

**After**:
```typescript
search_cross_reference: { max: 2000 }          // Reliable 3-5 second responses
search_enhanced_cross_reference: { max: 2000 } // Consistent high-quality correlation
```

**Tool Description Enhancement**:

    },
    limit: {
      type: "number",
      description: "Maximum results for correlation analysis (1-2000). Higher limits provide better correlation quality.",
      minimum: 1,
      maximum: 2000  // Optimized for correlation quality vs performance
    }
  }
}
```

## Tool Description Enhancement Patterns

### 1. Performance Context Integration

**Pattern**: Every tool description now includes performance expectations

**Template**:
```typescript
{
  description: `[Tool functionality description]

  Performance: [Response time expectations, memory usage, processing characteristics]

  [Additional context about limits, optimization, or usage patterns]`
}
```

**Example Implementation**:
```typescript
{
  name: "search_flows",
  description: `Search network flows with advanced query syntax and filtering.

  Performance: Optimized for 1000 results with 500-1500ms response times.
  Memory usage: 20-100MB depending on result complexity and time range.

  Supports complex queries with logical operators, wildcards, and ranges.
  Use pagination with cursor parameter for datasets larger than 1000 flows.`
}
```

### 2. Query Syntax Documentation

**Pattern**: Advanced search tools include comprehensive query examples

**Template**:
```typescript
{
  description: `[Tool description]

  Query Examples:
  - [Simple query example]
  - [Medium complexity example]
  - [Complex logical query example]
  - [Field-specific examples]`
}
```

**Example Implementation**:
```typescript
{
  name: "search_alarms",
  description: `Search security alarms with advanced filtering capabilities.

  Query Examples:
  - severity:high
  - severity:high AND source_ip:192.168.*
  - (severity:critical OR severity:high) AND protocol:tcp
  - blocked:true AND bytes:>10000000 AND country:China
  - timestamp:>NOW-24h AND NOT resolved:true`
}
```

### 3. Limit Justification

**Pattern**: Parameter descriptions explain why limits exist

**Template**:
```typescript
{
  parameters: {
    limit: {
      description: "Maximum results (min-max). [Reason for limit] [Performance impact] [Alternative approaches]"
    }
  }
}
```

**Example Implementation**:
```typescript
{
  parameters: {
    limit: {
      type: "number",
      description: "Maximum results (1-500). Lower limit due to bandwidth aggregation requiring significant memory and processing. Use multiple queries with time-based filtering for larger datasets.",
      minimum: 1,
      maximum: 500
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Usage Context Guidance

**Pattern**: Descriptions include when and how to use each tool

**Template**:

  - [Primary use case]
  - [Secondary use case]
  - [Advanced use case]

  Best Practices:
  - [Performance optimization tip]
  - [Query optimization tip]
  - [Result handling tip]`
}
```

### 5. Error Prevention Guidance

**Pattern**: Descriptions help users avoid common errors

**Template**:
```typescript
{
  description: `[Tool description]

  Common Issues:
  - [Issue 1]: [Prevention strategy]
  - [Issue 2]: [Prevention strategy]

  Troubleshooting:
  - If [condition]: [Solution]
  - For [scenario]: [Alternative approach]`
}
```

## Schema vs Implementation Alignment

### Pre-Enhancement Problems

1. **Misleading Limits**: Schemas suggested capabilities that caused timeouts
2. **Missing Context**: No performance guidance in parameter descriptions
3. **Inconsistent Standards**: Different tools used different limit philosophies
4. **Unclear Errors**: Parameter validation errors lacked context

### Post-Enhancement Standards

1. **Accurate Limits**: All schema limits match performance-tested maximums
2. **Contextual Descriptions**: Every parameter explains its constraints
3. **Consistent Patterns**: All similar tools follow the same limit philosophy
4. **Helpful Validation**: Errors include suggestions for parameter adjustment

### Validation Enhancement Example

**Before**:
```typescript
// Generic error with no context
"limit must be between 1 and 5000"
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Contextual error with guidance
"limit must be between 1 and 1000. Higher limits cause performance issues. Use pagination with cursor parameter for larger datasets. See docs/limits-and-performance-guide.md for details."
```

## Advanced Query Syntax Integration

### Query Documentation in Tool Descriptions

Every search tool now includes comprehensive query syntax examples:

#### Basic Query Patterns
```typescript
{
  description: `
  Basic Query Syntax:
  - field:value          # Exact match
  - field:value*         # Wildcard match
  - field:[min TO max]   # Range query
  - field:>value         # Comparison operators
  - field:>=value        # Greater than or equal

  Examples:
  - protocol:tcp
  - source_ip:192.168.*
  - bytes:[1000 TO 50000]
  - severity:>=medium
  - timestamp:>NOW-24h`
}
```

#### Logical Operators
```typescript
{
  description: `
  Logical Operators:
  - query1 AND query2    # Both conditions must match
  - query1 OR query2     # Either condition can match
  - NOT query           # Condition must not match
  - (query1 OR query2) AND query3  # Grouping with parentheses

  Examples:
  - severity:high AND protocol:tcp
  - (severity:high OR severity:critical) AND source_ip:192.168.*
  - blocked:true AND NOT source_ip:192.168.*`
}
```

#### Field-Specific Examples
```typescript
{
  description: `
  Field-Specific Query Examples:

  Network Fields:
  - source_ip:192.168.1.1 OR destination_ip:10.0.0.*
  - protocol:tcp AND port:443
  - asn:AS15169 AND country:United\ States

  Security Fields:
  - severity:high AND type:malware_detection
  - blocked:true AND threat_score:>0.8
  - resolved:false AND priority:urgent

  Temporal Fields:
  - timestamp:>NOW-1h
  - last_seen:<NOW-24h
  - created:2024-01-01..2024-01-31`
}
```

### Geographic Query Integration

Geographic search tools include specialized geographic query syntax:

```typescript
{
  description: `
  Geographic Query Enhancements:

  Country Filtering:
  - countries:["China", "Russia", "Iran"]        # Multiple countries (OR logic)
  - continents:["Asia", "Europe"]                # Continental filtering
  - regions:["Eastern Europe", "Middle East"]    # Regional filtering

  Infrastructure Filtering:
  - asns:["AS4134", "AS8075"]                    # Autonomous System Numbers
  - hosting_providers:["cloudflare", "amazon"]   # Cloud/hosting providers
  - exclude_cloud:true                           # Exclude cloud traffic
  - exclude_vpn:true                             # Exclude VPN/proxy traffic

  Risk-Based Filtering:
  - min_risk_score:0.7                          # Minimum geographic risk score
  - high_risk_countries:true                     # Known high-risk locations
  - threat_analysis:true                         # Enhanced threat intelligence`
}
```

## Error Context Enhancement

### Enhanced Error Messages

Tool descriptions now help users understand and prevent common errors:

#### Parameter Validation Errors
```typescript
{
  description: `
  Common Parameter Errors:

  Limit Too High:
  - Error: "limit exceeds maximum of 1000"
  - Solution: Use pagination with cursor parameter
  - Alternative: Apply more specific query filters

  Invalid Query Syntax:
  - Error: "unmatched parentheses in query"
  - Solution: Balance all parentheses: (condition1 OR condition2)
  - Check: Ensure quotes are properly closed

  Field Validation:
  - Error: "invalid field name 'unknown_field'"
  - Solution: Use documented field names (see query syntax guide)
  - Reference: docs/query-syntax-guide.md`
}
```

#### Timeout Prevention Guidance
```typescript
{
  description: `
  Timeout Prevention:

  If experiencing timeouts:
  1. Reduce limit parameter (try 100-500 for complex queries)
  2. Add more specific query filters to reduce dataset size
  3. Use time-based filtering: timestamp:>NOW-1h
  4. Avoid wildcard queries on large datasets

  Performance Tips:
  - Start with small limits and increase gradually
  - Use cursor pagination for large result sets
  - Apply filters before sorting when possible`
}
```

### Validation Message Enhancement

**Before**:
```typescript
"limit is required"
"query must be a string"
"invalid cursor format"
```

**After**:
```typescript
"limit parameter is required (1-1000). Specifies maximum results to return. Use pagination for larger datasets."

"query must be a valid search string. Examples: 'severity:high', 'protocol:tcp AND source_ip:192.168.*'. See docs/query-syntax-guide.md for complete syntax."

"cursor parameter has invalid format. Use cursor from previous response pagination.next_cursor field. Omit cursor for first page of results."
```

## Performance Guidance Integration

### Response Time Expectations

Tool descriptions now include specific performance guidance:

```typescript
{
  description: `
  Performance Characteristics:

  Response Times:
  - Simple queries (10-100 results): 200-500ms
  - Standard queries (100-1000 results): 500-1500ms
  - Complex queries with correlation: 1500-5000ms

  Memory Usage:
  - Typical request: 20-100MB
  - Large datasets: 100-300MB
  - Geographic enrichment: +50% memory overhead

  Optimization Tips:
  - Use specific queries to reduce processing time
  - Apply time-based filters to limit dataset scope
  - Consider multiple smaller queries vs one large query`
}
```

### Concurrent Usage Guidance

```typescript
{
  description: `
  Concurrent Usage:

  Recommended Limits:
  - Interactive usage: 1-5 concurrent requests
  - Batch processing: 5-10 concurrent requests
  - High-volume automation: 10+ requests (monitor performance)

  Rate Limiting:
  - API rate limits: 100 requests per minute
  - Burst capacity: Up to 20 requests per 10 seconds
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff on rate limit errors`
}
```
